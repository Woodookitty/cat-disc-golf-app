# cat-disc-golf-app
This is the beginning of a disc golf scoring application with cats!

### Architectural decisions as of version 0
##### Because this is just an application for learning javascript the first revision will only contain a few features:
 - One generic 18 hole option, no persistent courses
 - Session or local only storage of the cards created
 - No secure processing or logon information
 - Color coding of score cards based on scores below or over par 3 only
 - Cats.

### Future features you can expect in version 1 and beyond:
 - Three programmed in courses for users including all format options (step one. courses near Williamsburg VA)
 - Ability for users to create and store courses for personal use (step two)
 - Ability to create and store courses for others to use (a possibility if a decision is made to not tie it to another site's data such as PDGA or discgolfcoursereview.com) (step three)
 - Users will be able to store scorecards for future reference (locally, step one)
 - Users will be able to store scorecards for future reference (in a database, step two)
 - Scorecards will be able to be used to show average score for a user on a course
 - Users will be able to use themes for different cats
 - Users will be able to logon to a site to store data online or to use offline storage on their device (step one)

### Other info:
This is really as far as I've gotten in decisions for what to include, if you have ideas feel free to let me know.
